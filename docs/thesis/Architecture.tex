\section{Software Architecture}
This chapter describes the solution developed during our work. At the beginning the software architecture will be explained, followed by the partial steps and experiments which were needed to find the solution.

The software architecture has to fulfil multiple requirements for this project. First of all it should be able to support different input and output formats. Second the single algorithms should be executed combined to create different pipelines for different experiments.
\todo{Big Overview}
\\\\
To support the different input and output formats the architecture uses a meta format for the floor plans called AFImage.
