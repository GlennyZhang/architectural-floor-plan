\section{Abstract}
This work's main topic is the analysation of floor plans to detect and mark areas where different types of floor heatings will be installed. The idea is to automate this process for simple floor plans and provide additional tools to correct possible errors in more complicated plans.

This work will be split into sever parts. The first part will describe several algorithms used for preprocessing the image to remove any noise. Additionally, the algorithms for room detection and object detection will be explained.

The second part will contain the whole project management and implementation. This includes for example a timetable of our work, the class structure and much more information concerning the project setup and execution.

Last but not least, we will present and dicuss the results of our work. This also includes features that may be built in the future and the limitations of our work.
