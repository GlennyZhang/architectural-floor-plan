\subsection{Information Segmentation}
All of the following topics in this section are used to remove or add specific information from our image. The idea is to standardize all incoming floor plans regardless of what "noise" is around in the basic floor plan. Noise is anything that is of no importance to all the following algorithms. This contains elements such as "personal-property" (cars, pianos, etc.) as well as text or any lines to show dimensions on the plan. The idea would be that most of this noise is erased by the user in advance. But it is practically impossible to remove all the noise beforehand due to it being so time intensive that it would ruin all the benefits of the algorithm using less time than doing everything by hand.
